# Telco-Customer-Churn-rate-prediction-using-regression-model

EXPECTATION:
The telecommunication company expects to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company.

BRIEF SUMMARY:
The data set includes information about:
  Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
  Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method,paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
  Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
  Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
  
THE FLOW:
#Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Step 1: Capture the numeric and categorical variables.
Step 2: Make the necessary corrections. (Like variables with type errors)
Step 3: Observe the distribution of numerical and categorical variables in the data.
Step 4: Perform the target variable analysis according to the categorical variables.
Step 5: Check if there are any outliers.
Step 6: Check if there are any missing observations.

#Task 2 : Feature Engineering
Step 1: Take the necessary actions for missing and contradictory observations.
Step 2: Create new variables.
Step 3: Perform the encoding operations.
Step 4: Scale the numeric variables.

#Task 3: Modeling
Step 1: Build models with classification algorithms and examine accuracy scores. Choose the best model.
Step 2: Perform hyperparameter optimization with the model you selected and build the model with the hyperparameters that have been found
